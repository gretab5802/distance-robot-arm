# Distance Robot Arm

Project statement: How can we pick up a small object from a distance?

## Description

Pick small objects up from a distance with a glove, flex sensors, and robot arm.

## Getting Started

Requires two flex sensors, one button, one glove, two Arduino boards, two transceivers, two motors, and the appropriate wiring, 3d printing, and power sources. The flex sensors, one transceiver, one Arduino board, and the button are to be attached to the glove (transmitting end). The two motors, one transceiver, and one Arduino board are to be used on the arm (receiving end). The transceivers send the information from the glove to the robot arm.

### Dependencies

* Arduino IDE, available for Windows, Linux, and macOS
